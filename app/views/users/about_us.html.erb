I Tip Artists is a dynamic new online service designed to increase financial support for artists by directly connecting them with their patrons.  Using QR codes and smart phone technology to create a QRTip Jar, patrons support their favorite artists through direct donations.  The I Tip Artists web site offers additional features, including artist profile pages, a local calendar of arts events and weekly newsletter.
